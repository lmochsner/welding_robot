Robot Kinematics and Dynamics: Welding Robot

This code controls the HEBI Actuators on a five degree of freedom serial robot mechanism. Matlab and HEBI Actuators are necessary for this code to run.

The function RUN takes in a robot of class Robot3D and a array of waypoints in the workspace in the form [(x,y,z,),...]. The waypoints represent the position the end effector must be.
